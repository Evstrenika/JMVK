We didn't have time to update our local database to a cloud database due to the amount of time it took to 
set up the local database. When we first created our project it could work with iOS, Android and UWP but the 
UWP component does not have a file path. This caused issues with our local database and prevented us from doing 
the testing we needed. We spent a lot of time looking for a fix to this issue but in the end had to completely
rebuild our project with only iOS and Android and then bring our old files across to the new project. This caused
a significant time loss and meant we didn't have extra time left to reimplement the database in a cloud capacity.
